  <h1>Real Estate Business Analysis with Machine Learning</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The real estate business involves buying, selling, renting, and managing properties such as land, buildings, and homes. In this business, we face a key problem where we need to predict the price of a property based on factors like the buyer and seller's details. The goal of this project is to analyze real estate data and predict the price of properties based on various factors.</p>
    <h2>Business Problem</h2>
    <p>Two main factors in the business:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Buyer:</strong> The buyer's information and their needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Seller:</strong> The seller's details and their pricing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze the real estate data to understand key factors affecting the price of a property.</li>
        <li>Using machine learning to predict property prices based on various input factors.</li>
        <li>The target column for prediction is the <strong>price</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <h3>1. Data Gathering</h3>
    <p>Data for this project has been sourced from Kaggle and is in CSV format. This data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.</p>
    <h3>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
    <h4>Initial Data Analysis:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Pandas and NumPy to analyze the data shape, size, info, statistics, data types, and missing values.</li>
        <li>Perform univariate analysis on numerical columns (mean, median, mode, skewness, variance, standard deviation, min, max, range).</li>
        <li>Visualize the distribution of data using histograms.</li>
        <li>Check and handle outliers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Categorical Data Analysis:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify unique values and their counts in categorical columns.</li>
        <li>Use pie charts for better visualization.</li>
        <li>Replace missing values in categorical columns with the mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bivariate Analysis:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze the relationship between two columns (category vs numerical) using violin plots and box plots.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Feature Engineering</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Convert categorical columns into numerical values:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the replace() function to handle unique categorical values.</li>
            <li>If there are too many unique values, apply mapping techniques.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Drop unnecessary or redundant columns to reduce dimensionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. Feature Selection</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Calculate the correlation between variables (from -1 to +1) using Pearson's coefficient.</li>
        <li>Select the most relevant features based on the correlation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5. Model Training</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Target Column:</strong> The price column is the target variable for prediction.</li>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Since the data is labeled, we use regression models to predict the price.</li>
        <li>Apply Logistic Regression or Linear Regression for this problem.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>6. Model Evaluation</h3>
    <h4>For Regression:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the R-squared coefficient for evaluating the model's performance.</li>
    </ul>
   
   <h4>Hyperparameter Tuning:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model using Grid Search or Randomized Search with Cross-Validation (CV).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>7. Challenges and Scope for Improvement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Handling a large number of variables can be difficult and may require extensive feature engineering.</li>
        <li>Improving model accuracy by experimenting with different machine learning algorithms.</li>
        <li>Predicting the best property price based on location, buyer, and seller details.</li>
        <li>Forecasting market trends such as property demand.</li>
        <li>Fraud detection in property listings and financial risks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>8. Future Work</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Explore more advanced models such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting for improved accuracy.</li>
        <li>Integrate external data such as location-based data, neighborhood trends, and market indicators for better predictions.</li>
    </ul>
